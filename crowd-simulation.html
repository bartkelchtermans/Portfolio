                                    <h2 style="margin-top: 50px; margin-bottom: 0px;" class="infoLine">Introduction</h2>
                                    This project proposes a model for simulating human behavior in crowds, heavily based on psychology. <br>
                                    The model accounts for individual agents with their own, independently perceived environment and responses to said perceptions.
                                    At its core, it's an AI capable of dynamic collision avoidance on a basis of proxemics, other perceived entities and static obstacles.
                                    The model is also capable of navigating unknown environments by making use of target flow. <br>
                                    For the realism aspect, the AI is influenced by psychological behavior as well as have an identity model to mimic personality.

                                    <h2 style="margin-top: 40px; margin-bottom: 0px;" class="infoLine">Research</h2>
                                    For a period of 4 weeks I studied theoretical psychology to learn all about stress and its mathematical applications, proxemics and developments like the general adaption syndrome. <br>
                                    I also studied the influence of identity and personality on behavior, and sociological occurrences like authority and deindividuation. <br>
                                    Furthermore, I studied Helbing's <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/cond-mat/9805244.pdf">social force model</a> and searched for ways to improve on it.

                                    <h2 style="margin-top: 40px; margin-bottom: 0px;" class="infoLine">Development</h2>
                                    The crowd simulation is agent-based, so I built one agent and proceeded to use that agent to construct a crowd. <br>
                                    The agent is capable of dynamic collision avoidance and wants to maximize its degree of comfort at all times while also accomplishing its goal. <br>
                                    The behavior of the agent is fundamentally defined by the social force model, which, in this implementation, consists of driving forces, social forces and repulsive stress forces. <br>
                                    In addition to calculating and being influenced by positional stress and interpersonal stress, the AI also applies a form of herd behavior. <br>
                                    The identity model is one I composed myself, which I called the employed artificial identity, and it guarantees that every agent behaves in a unique fashion.
                                    It consists of 5 key attributes: dominance, agreeableness, anxiety, mobility and authority.
